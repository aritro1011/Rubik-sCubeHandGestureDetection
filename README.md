# Rubik-sCubeHandGestureDetection
This project demonstrates a Python-based solution for solving a 3D rendered Rubik's Cube using hand gestures captured by a webcam.  

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time hand gesture recognition:**
* Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate and efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition.
* **3D Rubik's Cube rendering:**
* Employs OpenGL for visually representing the rotating cube in a 3D environment.
  
* **Intuitive gesture controls:** 
    * **Right Hand:**
        * 4 fingers closed: Rotate front face clockwise.
        * 3 fingers closed: Rotate front face counterclockwise.
        * Index finger closed: Rotate first row left.
        * Index and middle finger closed: Rotate first row right.
        * Middle finger closed: Rotate second row left.
        * Middle and ring finger closed: Rotate second row right.
        * Ring finger closed: Rotate third row left.
        * Ring and pinky finger closed: Rotate third row right.
    * **Left Hand:**
        * 4 fingers closed: Rotate right face clockwise.
        * 3 fingers closed: Rotate right face counterclockwise.
        * Index finger closed: Rotate first column up.
        * Index and middle finger closed: Rotate first column down.
        * Middle finger closed: Rotate second column up.
        * Middle and ring finger closed: Rotate second column down.
        * Ring finger closed: Rotate third column up.
        * Ring and pinky finger closed: Rotate third column down.
* **User-friendly interface:** Provides basic camera controls for adjusting the viewing angle and distance.
